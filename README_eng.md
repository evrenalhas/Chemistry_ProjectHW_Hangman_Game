## Chemistry Hangman Game - README-eng.md

### Description
Hello! In this project, I am sharing the "Chemistry Hangman Game" that I developed using the Python programming language and the Pygame library. This game is based on the fundamental principles of the classic hangman game, but our word pool consists of chemistry-related terms. The aim is for players to test their knowledge and have fun while trying to guess words in the field of chemistry.

### Basic logic of the game
1) The player clicks on one of the letters on the screen and makes a guess.
2) If the guessed letter is present in the word, the letter appears on the screen, and the player receives feedback that they have guessed correctly.
3) If the guessed letter is not in the word, a piece is drawn on the chemistry man, and it is understood that the player has made an incorrect guess.
4) The player wins the game by correctly guessing all the letters and completing the word. If the chemistry man is completed and the word is still unsolved, the player loses the game.
5) At the end of the game, the player is shown what the word was and whether the result was correct or incorrect. Then, the player can restart the game if they wish.

### Requirements to run the game
1) Make sure Python 3.x and the Pygame library are installed on your computer.
2) Download all the files in this project to your computer and keep them in the same folder.
3) Go to the folder where the project is located using the terminal or command prompt.
4) Start the game using the command `py hangman.py`.

I hope you enjoy playing this game and improve your chemistry knowledge. Have fun!
